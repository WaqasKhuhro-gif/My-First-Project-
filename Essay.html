---

A webpage is a digital page that can be viewed on the internet through a web browser. It is a part of a website and usually contains text, images, videos, and links that provide information or services to users. Webpages are written using HTML and styled with CSS, while JavaScript is often used to make them interactive.

Webpages play an important role in sharing knowledge, communication, education, business, and entertainment. For example, companies use webpages to showcase their products, while students use them to study and gather information. A good webpage should be user-friendly, well-designed, and easy to navigate.

In today’s digital age, webpages have become a vital source of information and a bridge that connects people across the world.
